<h1>AnimeList</h1>

**Track All Your Anime**\
This application uses the JikanJS API as a database for anime, and allows you to plan and track the anime you've watched.

If you wish to clone the project and run it, simply do:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

Side Notes:
 The original was created with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript two years ago, but I couldn't get certain things working, so I decided to come back and finish the project. I created this application shortly after learning the basics of React. I enjoy watching anime, so I decided to amplify my learning by integrating this aspect of myself into a project. Lo and behold, animelist!
